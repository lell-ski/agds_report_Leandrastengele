## Project overview

Exercise 1, Phenology modelling: Calibrate and optimize a growing degree-day (GDD) leaf-out model using PhenoCam observations. Propose 3 improvement ideas and implement one idea: weighted temperatue. Spatial upscaling with DAYMET temperature data greater Boston and compare the predicted leaf-out day DOY with MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology.

Exercise 2, Digital soil mapping: Build a random-forest model to predict soil waterlogging from soil and environmental observations, including feature selection with Boruta and hyperparameter tuning 

Key outputs:
- The models mentioned above
- visualizations of the model outputs as plots and figures


## Data
Tutorials, Workflows and Datasources not explicitly mentioned below are obtained from the course applied geodata science II (AGDS II), University of Bern: https://github.com/geco-bern 

### Phenology modelling (Exercise 1)
- PhenoCam data: Downloaded the phenocamr package which interfaces with the phenocam network API to download time series of vegetation greenness and derived phenology metrics
- DAYMET data: from the course applied geodata science II, University of Bern (book: handfull of pixels): https://github.com/fabern/handfull_of_pixels/raw/refs/heads/main/data/DAYMET.004_2012/DAYMET.004_1km_aid0001.nc 
- MODIS MCD12Q2: Band `Greenup.Num_Modes_01` for yr 2012 for greater Boston, retrieved via `MODISTools::mt_subset(). Package: MODISTools

### Digital soil mapping (Exercise 2)
- Soil and covariate table "df_full.rds": Is obtained from the course applied geodata science II (AGDS II), University of Bern: https://github.com/geco-bern

## How to reproduce the analysis
1. Open the RStudio project agds_report_Leandrastengele.Rproj. 
2. Install te required packages (see below)
3. open the .rmd files in vignettes/phenology_modelling_ex1.Rmd or vignettes/digital_soil_mapping_ex2.Rmd respectively
4. run the full code or knit to HTML. This will download the required data, run the models and generate the desired outputs.


## Results
All the results are directly generated in the .rmd and will be visible in the .html document
