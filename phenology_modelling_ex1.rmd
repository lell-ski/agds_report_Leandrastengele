```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Get started

```{r cars}
install.packages("phenocamr")

# I will use the phenocamr package which 
# interfaces with the phenocam network API
# to download time series of vegetation 
# greenness and derived phenology metrics
library(phenocamr)


```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
